## Past highlights

Here are a few highlights of some prior science communication work, including recorded talks (virtual and in-person), podcasts, and interviews.  

### Who is most exposed to PFAS in drinking water?
*Emerging Contaminants in the Environment Conference (2024)*

This was a keynote talk I gave as part of the Emerging Contaminants in Environment Conference, co-hosted by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center and Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant. See the full video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C47MS23-xLw).

### Tools to address environmental justice gaps
*National PFAS Conference (2024)*

It was an honor to participate in a panel on environmental justice at the National PFAS Conference, held in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2024. I first attended this conference in 2022 as a newly minted PhD student. See the panel (presentations, slides, and discussion) [here](https://www.nationalpfasconference.org/2024videos).
