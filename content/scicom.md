### Tools to address environmental justice gaps
*National PFAS Conference (2024)*

It was an honor to participate in a panel on environmental justice at the National PFAS Conference, held in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2024. I first attended this conference in 2022 as a newly minted PhD student. See the panel (presentations, slides, and discussion) [here](https://www.nationalpfasconference.org/2024videos).
